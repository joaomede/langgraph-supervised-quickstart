We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a confidential Security Advisory as described in `SECURITY.md`. Project maintainers commit to fair and timely review.

If you are uncomfortable using GitHub Security Advisories, you can also open a private issue or reach out via the repository owner profile.
